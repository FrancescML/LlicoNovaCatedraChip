# UPC Python Cookbook

_UPC Python Cookbook_ intends to become your starting point into Python and guide your learning process from the ground up. It is aimed at anyone who has a background in programming in some other language and is looking for a foundation in the main tools and features of Python.

It is structured in sections that combine explanations, code, animations and links to the official documentation. Each one is essentially self-contained but it may include references to some topics mentioned in previous sections.
