# Disjoint sets

TBD: Intro

We present three succesive implementations (is it necessary?).

## Implementation with simple MF-sets

TBD: Explain

```c++

<!--@include: ./disjoint-sets-1.cc-->

```

## Implementation with MF-sets by size

TBD: Explain

```c++
<!--@include: ./disjoint-sets-2.cc-->
```

## Implementation with MF-sets by size and with path compression

TBD: Explain

```c++
<!--@include: ./disjoint-sets-3.cc-->
```
